# chapel-highlight README

This Visual Studio Code extension provides basic syntax highlighting for the Chapel language.

## Features

Syntax highlighting based on the [Chapel Textmate bundle](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel-tmbundle)

This extension is intended to replace a [similar extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=frumbasjt.chapel) that has become out of date with the current syntax of the Chapel language.

## Known Issues

Doesn't correctly handle uninterpreted string or byte literals (also a limitation of the Chapel Textmate bundle). 

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 0.0.1

Initial release based on chapel-tmbundle Git commit f2a1430

## Report an Issue

This plugin will be updated semi-regularly in line with the [Chapel Textmate bundle](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel-tmbundle), which defines a Textmate language syntax that is used for highlighting in this extension, Github linguist and other tools.
